# ChattBank

This was the final project for my C# Programming II class. The assignment was to build a functional banking application. While the instructor provided the database, it was my responsibility to design, build, document, and present the program.

The instructor provided several different levels of this project that accounted for a variable number of points for one's grade. I chose the one that provided the max grade for the project. The requirements for this level are listed below.

* Build project as a Windows Form Project
* A new customer should be able to do the following
    * Log in to their bank account
    * View all of their accounts in list form without supplying account numbers
    * Create new bank accounts
    * Deposit or withdraw from any account
* Admin should be able to do the following
    * Sign in as admin
    * Create customers
    * Delete customers

In addition to meeting these requirements, I also made it possible for the admin user to search the database for customers by customer ID and also edit customer data.

The first step of my design process was to take a look at the provided database and take notes on what kind of Classes/Objects I would need for the application. I then moved on to further defining the Classes by charting out what properties and methods each Class might need. Once I had a workable understanding of my backend requirements, I moved onto UI design.

While designing the UI, my focus was on a clean and inviting interface. As with any UI, I wanted to make sure it was easy to navigate and accessible by keeping the clutter down to a minimum. Additionally, I tried to make sure that the text in the UI provided clear instructions for how to use the application. I sketched out several design options before settling on the one that I felt best met my criteria.
Once I had a design locked in place, I made a list of Forms that I would need for the program. After establishing the basics, I sketched mockups of each Form using my chosen design.

Once I completed the design phase, I moved on to creating the Forms and Classes in Visual Studio. This part was fairly straight-forward thanks to all my earlier planning. There were a few changes I had to make to some of the Forms to account for unexpected problems. Mostly I was concerned about font sizing and trying to make sure that the text was easy to read. Besides this, everything else went smoothly.

I'm very conscientious about using comments to document my projects as I go. By this time in the project, the documentation was practically already done. I was not required to submit a separate document with instructions for this project. All of the documentation is within the code comments and the UI text.

The final step before presenting the project was to run the program and debug any errors. I do some debugging as I go. For example, I made sure database access was functional early on so I could test the functionality of the Forms as I programmed them. There were a few things that I struggled with during this phase of development. I had some difficulty in getting the customer accounts to show correctly; however, I was able to work it all out in the end with some minor code changes.

Once I was satisfied with the functionality of the application and felt that I met all of the requirements, I presented the completed application to the instructor via video. I'm planning in the near future to rerecord a presentation video that I will link below for those who wish to see the application in action.
